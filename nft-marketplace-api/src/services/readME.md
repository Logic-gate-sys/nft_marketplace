----------------------- Summary --------------------------------------------
🌟 In summary:
 services should;

I. Contain all marketplace’s business logic (rules for minting, listing, buying, transferring).
II. Perform multi-step operations in a transaction.
III. Handle external API calls (IPFS, payments).



--------------------------- CORE FUCNTIOALITIES THAT BACKEND MUST SUPPORT ----------------------------------

✅ 1. USER MANAGEMENT - (Authentication & Profiles)

 **Sign up / Register**
* Create a new user (username, email, wallet address).
* Store securely (hash passwords if you’re handling them).

✔ **Login**
* JWT-based authentication (`signToken` and `verifyToken`).
* Return a token to be used for all protected endpoints.

  **Connect Wallet**                   <------------- attention here when connecting to smartcontract
* Store user’s wallet address or update it.
* Verify ownership (e.g., by signing a nonce).

✔ **View & Update Profile**
* Fetch user info (name, email, NFTs owned, etc.).



2. NFT MANAGEMENT
  **Mint NFT**
* Accept metadata (name, description, image URL from IPFS).
* Interact with smart contract (on-chain mint) **OR** store in database for off-chain testing.
* Save NFT record in Postgres with `status = 'NEW'`.

  **List NFT for Sale**
* Only allow if user is owner.
* Update `status = 'LISTED'`.
* Set price, currency, expiration.

✔ **Get NFT Details**
* Fetch by `id` (include metadata, owner info, status, price).

✔  **Browse/Filter NFTs**
* Search by name, price range, owner, status, etc.


3. BUYING & OWNERSHIP TRANSFER - (Marketplace flow)

**Buy NFT** (the 3-step process you described):
1. **Lock NFT**: `status = 'CALCULATING'` (prevent double-buy).
2. **Process Payment**: integrate with payment provider or blockchain transaction.
3. **Transfer Ownership**: update `owner_id` and set `status = 'NEW'`.

 Needs to be wrapped in a **transaction** or handled with a **smart contract** to ensure atomicity.

 **Handle Failures**
* If step 3 fails, refund or retry (or use escrow/payment intent).


4. TRANSACTION & HISTORY MANAGEMENT

 **Record Transactions**
* When an NFT is bought or transferred, create a record:
  * `buyer_id`, `seller_id`, `nft_id`, `price`, `timestamp`.

 **View Purchase History**
* Fetch all transactions for a given user or NFT.

5. SYNCHRONISATION WITH BLOCKCHAIN (if on-chain)

 **Listen to smart contract events** (e.g., `Transfer`, `Minted`)
* Update your Postgres DB when events are emitted.

 **Verify on-chain ownership**
* When needed, query the smart contract to ensure DB matches chain.

6. ADMIN/UTILITY OPERATIONS --  (optional but helpful)

 **Admin Listing Management**
* Force unlist NFTs (e.g., fraud cases).
* Manage reported NFTs/users.

 **Analytics / Insights**
* Count NFTs listed, sold, total volume, etc.

**Example Service Layer Functions**
* `userService.registerUser(data)`
* `userService.loginUser(email, password)`
* `nftService.mintNFT(metadata, userId)`
* `nftService.listNFT(nftId, price, userId)`
* `nftService.getNFT(nftId)`
* `nftService.buyNFT(nftId, buyerId)`
* `transactionService.getTransactionsForUser(userId)`

**Next Steps / Best Practices**

✅ **Plan your endpoints:**

* `POST /auth/signup`
* `POST /auth/login`
* `POST /nfts/mint`
* `PATCH /nfts/:id/list`
* `POST /nfts/:id/buy`
* `GET /nfts`
* `GET /nfts/:id`
* `GET /users/:id/transactions`

**Use transactions in critical flows (buy/sell)**
**Use services to hold your business logic**
**Consider payment-intent or on-chain atomic transactions** for safety.






------------------------ UNIQUE SELLING POINT ---------------------------------------

💡 4. What makes your marketplace unique?
Here are ideas to differentiate yourself:

✅ Attach clear commercial licenses to NFTs

“Buy this NFT and you get full commercial printing rights for life.”

✅ Offer unlockable high‑res files only to the owner

The preview on the site might be 800×800.
When someone buys the NFT, they unlock a private link (or encrypted IPFS) to download the 4K vector file ready for print.

✅ Community perks for holders

Give holders access to new art drops, collabs, discounts, or even revenue sharing.

✅ Verification tools

A public page where anyone can enter a token ID and see:
✅ “Yes, this NFT has full printing rights.”
✅ “Owned by wallet X.”

✅ Smart contract royalty enforcement

Artists still earn on secondary sales — a unique selling point for creators.

🚫 Why copying won’t give them the same value
A copycat only gets the pixels, not the license or rights.

A copycat can’t resell it as part of the collection on-chain.

A copycat can’t claim provenance or future utilities tied to the NFT.

Serious businesses & collectors want verifiable rights, not stolen art.

📦 How to build this into your NFT marketplace
Here’s a roadmap for you:

✅ Step 1: Mint your NFTs with metadata that includes a license field.

✅ Step 2: Restrict high‑res files to NFT owners (e.g., via token‑gated downloads).

✅ Step 3: Add terms of service saying only NFT owners have commercial rights.
✅ Step 4: Market the collection as utility art — not just images but rights.

👉 Imagine your pitch:

“On our marketplace, you’re not just buying an image.
You’re buying a license to use that art commercially — for T‑shirts, posters, and more.
Each NFT unlocks high‑resolution, print‑ready files and verifiable rights recorded on-chain.”

That’s powerful.
That’s why someone pays — they want rights, provenance, and access they can’t get by copying.
